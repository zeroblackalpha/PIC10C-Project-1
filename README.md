# PIC10C-Project-1
This is a project for my PIC10C course at UCLA.
The goal is to create my own implementation of a templatized vector class with all the same features as the vector class in the standard template library vector class.
The grades for this assignment do not come from the functioning of the project, but a demonstration of a familiarity with various git commands and features as to be seen in my commit history.

## Special git features tried:
None so far.
